                    <section>
                        <p>The XDI Graph Editor is a visualization tool that facilitates exploring and editing XDI graphs. Following the XDI notation, graphs are represented using circles and lines for XDI nodes and links. In this document, we'll refer to node and link as <b>element</b> in general.</p>

                    <section>
                        <section><p>The following steps allow you to explore some of the tool's main capabilities by creating a small XDI graph.

                            <b>Step 1</b> - Creating a minimal graph by importing an XDI statement
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    To do so, click on <b>File</b> and then <b>Import XDI</b> button and enter the following line:
                                    <code>[=]!:uuid:1111/$is$ref/=alice</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>Click the <b>Graph It</b> button and you will see a graph with 4 nodes and 4 links.</li>
                                <li>Some things worth noting on the generated graph:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The white node is the common root.</li>
                                        <li>The dashed red line is a relational statement while the gray lines are contextual statements.</li>
                                        <li>Edges are labeled in light gray while nodes are labeled in black.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><i>Note that you may enter several XDI single display line statements at once.</i>
                                </li>

                                <li>Select a node by clicking on it or drag from an empty space on the screen to select multiple nodes</li>

                                <li>Drag from the <i>=bob</i> node to the <i>=bob<#email></i> node.</li>
                                <li>After releasing it, a new link appears between the 2 nodes. Notice that the label of the link is automatically inferred from the nodes labels.</li>
                                <li>For consistency, link the common root node to the <i>=bob</i> node.</li>

                                <li>You'll see an intermediary node is automatically created and both links with proper <i>&</i> labels added. Also note that the <i>"bob@email.biz"</i> node is now a literal node (green stroke).</li>

                        <p>There are three checkboxes:</p>

                            <li><b>Combine with current graph</b>: if checked, the statements imported will be added to the current graph. This assumes there are common nodes between the existing graph and the imported statements.</li>
                            <li><b>Fold Root</b>: if checked, the nodes under the <i>Common Root Node</i> of the imported graph will be folded.</li>

                        <p><i>Tip: The <b>Fold Root</b> option helps avoid overwhelming elements when importing large graphs. The <b>Unfold Level 1</b> function can then be used to unfold only the direct descendants of the common root node.</i>
